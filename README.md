## Goals :

Your task is to develop a Flutter application for buyers and sellers that contains the following features:

- Registration: create profiles for sellers (name, contact, image, balance) and buyers (name, email, balance) with authentication
- Pricing: sellers should be able to generate and sell items for a price on their home page
- Market Place: a page for buyers to view and purchase from all available items; once purchased, remove the item from display
- Home Page: for the buyer: display all purchased items and current balance; for the seller: display all items sold and current balance
- Database: utilize a MySQL database for user profiles, token data, and transactions and manage realtime updates

## Status:
- Opening screen (where the user chooses buyer or seller) and the login screen for buyer and seller is implemented in main.dart,buyersignin.dart and sellersignin.dart.
- Connected with my local mysql database and currently trying to implement authentication part (facing issues like user not found even with correct credentials).
